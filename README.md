# 🐾 PawPal – A Digital Network for Animal Welfare (Prototype)

**PawPal** is a civic-minded web prototype designed to support animal welfare efforts in Pakistan through technology and community engagement. Developed as part of an academic initiative, PawPal aims to connect citizens with the tools to report cruelty, locate help, and raise awareness about animal rights.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This is a prototype. Some features like maps, donation processing, and admin control are not fully functional or simulated only.

## 📌 Executive Summary

PawPal was inspired by a personal tragedy when a team member lost his dog, Zorro, due to lack of immediate veterinary support. This experience motivated the creation of a simple, accessible platform to help prevent similar situations by connecting the public to shelters, vets, and educational resources.

Even though this project is not yet production-ready, it showcases a scalable model of what a tech-driven animal welfare ecosystem could look like.

## 1. Background & Motivation

The project was born out of the emotional loss of a beloved pet, Zorro, which underscored the absence of immediate animal care solutions in Pakistan. This sparked the development of PawPal as a centralized portal for timely action and awareness around animal care.

---

## 2. The Need for a Welfare Platform

Pakistan lacks a dedicated digital platform for animal rescue and cruelty reporting. Issues include:

- Delayed or absent responses
- Lack of public awareness of legal protections
- No centralized database for shelters or veterinary services

**PawPal** aims to fill that gap by offering reporting tools, verified listings, and educational resources.
